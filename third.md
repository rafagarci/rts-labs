# Python improvement

If I could change something about Python (one of my favorite programming languages), I would change the 'threading' module so that it could handle multithreaded programs without limiting performance to about one core (There is a global lock that forces all threads to use the same interpreter, limiting performance significantly). I would implement it so that Python could run multithreaded programs like C or C++ where all available processing resources can be utilized. This would simply make python programs that use the 'threading' module faster. A somewhat workaround is available already where you can use the 'multiprocessing' module instead. The problem is that this module takes longer to initialize processes and that synchronizing these and program variables is trickier than synchronizing threads. This is why I think improving the 'threading' module could improve the language performance wise.
